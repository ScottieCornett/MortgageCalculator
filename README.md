  ## Code Kentucky Final Project
  ## Mortgage Calculator Console Application
  
  ## Features:
  - Master loop to verify data
  - LINQ query to show average mortgage payments from across the country for comparison purposes
  - Unit testing to verify working methods
  
  
  My program is a mortgage calculator. It asks users to input basic information about their mortgage: the principal, annual percentage rate, and the
  amount of time to mortgage is for. It uses methods in the Mortgage Calculator class to calculate their payments, and if requested, a payment schedule
  showing how many payments they'll need to make. I also chose to include a LINQ query to show the average mortgage payment from the 50 US states. This data was
  obtained from joywallet.com. I put unit tests into the application where I created a Mortgage Calculator object, then ran tests to make sure my methods were
  working properly.
