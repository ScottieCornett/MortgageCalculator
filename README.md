  ## Code Kentucky Final Project
  ## Mortgage Calculator Console Application
  
  ## Features:
  - Master loop to verify data
  - Unit testing to verify working methods
  
  
  My program is a mortgage calculator. It asks users to input basic information about their mortgage: the principal, annual percentage rate, and the
  amount of time to mortgage is for. It uses methods in the Mortgage Calculator class to calculate their payments, and if requested, a payment schedule
  showing how many payments they'll need to make.
